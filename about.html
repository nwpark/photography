		About<br>
		<br>
		Born in Bath City, Somerset, 1993. I was given my first camera at the age of 9. 
		I decided to pursue Photography after studying fine art, photography and theatre 
		studies at Alevel I continued onto University and studied Fashion Photography at 
		Southampton Solent University which I will graduated from towards the end of 
		2015. <br>
		<br>
		Much of the work that is featured on my website is work I did for my university 
		projects and work in my own time. I like to make each shoot I do very different 
		which is why I have experimented with incorporating art into my work as well as 
		fashion and landscape. I like to make sure I have an equal amount of studio shots 
		aswell as on location to show off my capability to achieve both with great 
		pictures.<br>
		<br>
		I have been very fortunate enough to work for Emilio De La Morena who designs 
		high fashion Cocktail dresses; I had the opportunity to photograph all his 
		collections from 2013-2014 and Photograph backstage at his show for London 
		Fashion week as well as the Catwalk. <br>
		<br>
		I am currently about to finish my Fashion Photography Degree and hope to 
		pursue in the industry, it would be great to work for a big designer again and 
		work my way up in the industry, I am currently living in Southampton.
